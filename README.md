# Robust CAPTCHA System – Traditional + Adversarial Techniques

This project presents an **intelligent CAPTCHA system** that is designed to resist automated recognition attempts by malicious OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools using **adversarial machine learning techniques**. The system combines traditional CAPTCHA generation methods with adversarial noise to create visually readable but OCR-resistant images.

## 🔍 Objective

To enhance the security of CAPTCHA systems by introducing adversarial perturbations that fool OCR models while remaining readable to human users.

## 🚀 Features

- Traditional CAPTCHA image generation
- Adversarial noise application using ML models
- Resistance testing against common OCR techniques
- Evaluation metrics for image robustness
- Human-readable, machine-resistant CAPTCHA designs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- PIL / OpenCV
- Flask (if web interface is included)
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Generate CAPTCHA images using predefined characters/fonts.
2. Apply adversarial noise using a trained model to reduce OCR success rates.
3. Evaluate using a simulated OCR model.
4. Analyze success rate of human vs. machine recognition.
